        <h3>Hi there!</h3>
        <p>
          I'm Ego. I started learning about web development in college period
          with a little knowledge. So, in early 2023, I decided to pursue about
          web development. Also, I started watching a lot of youtube videos,
          join some course, and take mentorship to explore more about web
          development especially front-end development.
        </p>
        <h3>Why Front-End Developer?</h3>
        <p>
          I love to translate every idea into beautiful and functional website.
          As a front-end developer, I am motivated to learn a lot of
          technologies about front-end development. I am passionate about
          learning new technologies and improve my self.
